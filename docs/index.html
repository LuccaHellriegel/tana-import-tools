    <h1>Inofficial Obsidian-2-Tana Converter</h1>
    <p>
      Select a zip of your Obsidian vault folder and get a TIF file back, ready to be imported in Tana.<br />
      <em>
        Zip the central vault folder directly (not just the sub-folders) and don't rename the zip file. Example: my
        vault is called pkm, this is also the name of its folder and the zip file is called pkm.zip.
      </em>
    </p>
    <b>There is no server involved in the conversion, the zip file will stay on your computer.</b>
